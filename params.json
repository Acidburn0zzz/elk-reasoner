{"name":"Elk-reasoner","tagline":"A Java-based OWL 2 EL reasoner","body":"ELK is an ontology reasoner with the goal of supporting the [OWL 2 EL profile](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-profiles/#OWL_2_EL). For further information, please see the [ELK online documentation](https://github.com/live-ontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki).\r\n\r\n# Downloads\r\n\r\nThe ELK reasoner can be downloaded in various ways, depending on the desired usage.\r\n\r\nFile releases of ELK are published as ZIP files and can be found in the Maven Central. The latest stable version is 0.4.2. There are currently three forms of packaged releases:\r\n\r\n- [elk-distribution-0.4.2-owlapi-library.zip](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/semanticweb/elk/elk-distribution/0.4.2/elk-distribution-0.4.2-owlapi-library.zip) provides a package for [using ELK from OWL API](https://github.com/live-ontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki/ElkOwlApi).\r\n- [elk-distribution-0.4.2-protege-plugin.zip](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/semanticweb/elk/elk-distribution/0.4.2/elk-distribution-0.4.2-protege-plugin.zip) provides a package for [using ELK as a Protégé plugin](https://github.com/live-ontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki/ElkProtege).\r\n- [elk-distribution-0.4.2-standalone-executable.zip](http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/semanticweb/elk/elk-distribution/0.4.2/elk-distribution-0.4.2-standalone-executable.zip) provides a package for using ELK as a standalone tool that is controlled via a [command line client](https://github.com/live-ontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki/ElkCommandLine).\r\n\r\nPlease see the [Getting ELK page](https://github.com/live-ontologies/elk-reasoner/wiki/GettingElk) for more information and links to the previous versions.\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nELK has been developed in the [Institut of Artificial Intelligence](http://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/ki.html) of the [University of Ulm](http://www.uni-ulm.de/en/homepage.html) and in the [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning group](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/knowledge/) at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) of the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).
